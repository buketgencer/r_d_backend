  "chunk_text": "My code for that is: Placeteapot.cs :  I have a list of reference points (referencePoints and referenceUVs) that define my homography.  For each image, I have scene points in coordinatesList.  I compute the homography with the same method: ComputeHomography(...).  Then for each new image, I apply the homography to the scene points. This gives me the location where the teapot should go in the image.  I do a small rotation calculation using CalculateRotation(...). This helps orient the teapot in 2D. When I click NextImage or PreviousImage, it moves to another image in the imageSet list. The script calls ApplyHomography for that scene point, and I place the teapot’s transform to that position. 2.2.1 Issues and Observations  Because I manually pick points for each image, the results look better.  I noticed that sometimes the rotation is not perfect, so I used referencePoints[0] as a reference for the angle. This might not be perfect, but it works enough for demonstration. 3. Conclusion and Remarks  I tried two main ways to solve Part 2: 1. 3D Reconstruction via VisualSFM: My reconstruction was not good enough, leading to big errors in projecting back to the 2D images. 2.",
