Then I have two transformation functions:  TransformSceneToImage: projects a scene point onto the image plane,  TransformImageToScene: projects an image point onto the scene plane. Finally, I have CalculateError to compute the average or normalized reprojection error.  1.2 Testing the Homography (HomographyTest.cs) I created a HomographyTest script to check if my homography calculations are correct. It contains: 1. Some scenePoints and imagePoints that I manually matched. In my case, I found 5 correspondence points. 2.",
