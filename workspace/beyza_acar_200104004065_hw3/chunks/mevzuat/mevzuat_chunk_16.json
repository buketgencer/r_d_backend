  "chunk_text": "My steps: 1. I ran VisualSFM to compute camera poses and 3D points (the point cloud). 2. This gave me an .nvm file with camera intrinsics, extrinsics, and the 3D points in the scene. 3. I wrote an NvmParser script in Unity to read the .nvm file, parse cameras, and identify green points (like the USB cable). NvmParser outputs:  I also made a script named CylinderPlacement to place a 3D object (cylinder) at the green point in the scene. I extracted the camera rotation matrix from the quaternion, then used a simple pinhole projection.",
