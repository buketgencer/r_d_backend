I extracted the camera rotation matrix from the quaternion, then used a simple pinhole projection. I wanted to see the object in the real image view. 2.1.1 Why It Failed  My point cloud was not dense enough, so the reprojected images looked incomplete.  The alignment with the actual photo was not correct in 2D space.  The method required a perfect 3D reconstruction to overlay the object in the final 2D images. But the reconstruction had many holes and was messy. Hence, I realized this was not what the homework wanted. The homework wants the teapot over the 2D images in a robust way. So I abandoned this approach. 2.2 Manual Homography Approach (Final Approach) I decided to place the object using a manual approach similar to Part 1.",
