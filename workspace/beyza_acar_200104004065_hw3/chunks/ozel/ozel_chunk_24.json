The program calculates the distance in pixels between the real image point and the projected point.  Since the image resolution is 3264×24483264 \\times 24483264×2448, I normalized this error by dividing it by the diagonal length of the image (calculated using the width and height).  My final error was not zero, but it was acceptable.",
