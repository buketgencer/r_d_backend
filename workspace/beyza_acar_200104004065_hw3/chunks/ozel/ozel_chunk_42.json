My code for that is: Placeteapot.cs :  I have a list of reference points (referencePoints and referenceUVs) that define my homography.  For each image, I have scene points in coordinatesList.  I compute the homography with the same method: ComputeHomography(...).  Then for each new image, I apply the homography to the scene points.",
