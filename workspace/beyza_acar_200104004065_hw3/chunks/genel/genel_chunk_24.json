Conclusion and Remarks  I tried two main ways to solve Part 2: 1. 3D Reconstruction via VisualSFM: My reconstruction was not good enough, leading to big errors in projecting back to the 2D images. 2. Manual Homography (like Part 1), which gave me a simpler and more direct method to overlay the teapot on each 2D image.  For Part 1, I successfully wrote: o A linear SVD-based homography solver, o A function for non-linear gradient descent (though not heavily used here), o Transformation methods to project points from scene to image and image to scene, o An error calculation method to see how close the projected points are.  For Part 2, I placed the teapot using the same homography approach, but done for each of the 19 images. I only needed a small set of point correspondences for each image. The results look good enough for the assignment.  My code references and screenshots of Python scripts used to find pixel coordinates and the VisualSFM process will be included in the submission.  I have some mistakes: The coordinate system difference (x vs. y flipped) made me do extra checks, and my 3D approach was not completed because the point cloud was too sparse.",
