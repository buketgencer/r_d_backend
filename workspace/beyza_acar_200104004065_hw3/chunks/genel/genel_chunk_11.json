Scene and image points to calculate homography: Apply the homography matrix: Outputs: Error rate: 1.3 Notes on Coordinate Systems  My image coordinates had x and y swapped compared to the professor’s. This means I had to switch (x,y)(x, y)(x,y) to (y,x)(y, x)(y,x) in some places.  I used a small Python script to detect or measure the image coordinates (for instance, reading pixel values in an image viewer). Then I manually typed them into the code. 1.4 Results and Errors  After calculating the transformation matrix HHH, I printed its values in the console for verification.  I used 3 additional scene points to test the error. The program calculates the distance in pixels between the real image point and the projected point.  Since the image resolution is 3264×24483264 \\times 24483264×2448, I normalized this error by dividing it by the diagonal length of the image (calculated using the width and height).  My final error was not zero, but it was acceptable.",
