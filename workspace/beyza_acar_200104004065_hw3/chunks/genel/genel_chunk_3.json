Part 1: Homography Computation 1.1 Homography Calculation Function I wrote a C# class named HomographyCalculator to calculate the homography matrix. The key function is: public static Matrix<double> CalculateHomography( List<Tuple<double, double>> scenePoints, List<Tuple<double, double>> imagePoints) It takes a list of scene points (e.g., (xi,yi)(x_i, y_i)(xi,yi)) and corresponding image points (e.g., (ui,vi)(u_i, v_i)(ui,vi)).",
