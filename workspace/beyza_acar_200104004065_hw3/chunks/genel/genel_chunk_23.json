  "chunk_text": "This helps orient the teapot in 2D. When I click NextImage or PreviousImage, it moves to another image in the imageSet list. The script calls ApplyHomography for that scene point, and I place the teapot’s transform to that position. 2.2.1 Issues and Observations  Because I manually pick points for each image, the results look better.  I noticed that sometimes the rotation is not perfect, so I used referencePoints[0] as a reference for the angle. This might not be perfect, but it works enough for demonstration. 3. Conclusion and Remarks  I tried two main ways to solve Part 2: 1. 3D Reconstruction via VisualSFM: My reconstruction was not good enough, leading to big errors in projecting back to the 2D images. 2. Manual Homography (like Part 1), which gave me a simpler and more direct method to overlay the teapot on each 2D image.  For Part 1, I successfully wrote: o A linear SVD-based homography solver, o A function for non-linear gradient descent (though not heavily used here), o Transformation methods to project points from scene to image and image to scene, o An error calculation method to see how close the projected points are.  For Part 2, I placed the teapot using the same homography approach, but done for each of the 19 images.",
